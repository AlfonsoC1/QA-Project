<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>Year Up is non-profit organization that provides young adults, ages 18-24, with the necessary technical, professional, and communication skills that will allow them to be successful at a big corporation all in the span of one year. Year Up is an intense training program that expects the most out of the students once being in the program; and with a combination of hands-on development, college credits, corporate internship, and support, students are able to find their own career path in the tech industry.</p>
	<p>Year Up has a mission they want to achieve and that is to close the opportunity divide. What is the opportunity divide? Let me put it this way, “Millions of young adults in the US have the talent and motivation, but lack the opportunity. At the same time, companies have opportunities available, but lack the talents they need to succeed.” This is where Year Up comes into action by teaching all the necessary skills one needs to gain an internship and fill in the gaps.</p>
	<p> Here is a much more helpful visual to kind of see what it is.</p>

	<p>As you can see, we have a long way to go. To get the 6 million young adult to fill in for the 12 million open jobs will take a long time. For this reason, Year Up is expanding throughout the US. Year Up was founded in Boston, MA in 2000 and so far has expanded throughout 15 other states.</p>

Here at the San Francisco campus, as for the technical classes, it offers 5 tracks: Cyber Security, Quality Assurance, Project Coordination, System Administration, and Information Technology (IT) Desk Support. San Francisco takes in 120 students every cycle. In San Jose, 80 students are enrolled annually.</p>
